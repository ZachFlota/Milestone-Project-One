Robot Defender 

Aliens are dropping bombs on the city! Deploy the Robot Defender to shoot the bombs and missiles out of the air before they land in the street or on a car.

Move the Robot Defender from left to right using the left and right arrow keys. 

When under a falling bomb or missile, press the Spacebar to shoot them. 

You get points for each bomb or missile you eliminate; however, the closer a bomb or missile gets to street, the less points you recieve. 

If a bomb or missile hits a passing vehicle, you will lose health. 

Keep scoring points until your health runs out.
